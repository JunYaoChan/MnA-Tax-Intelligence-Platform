Section 338(h)(10) Election Requirements

Section 338(h)(10) Election Overview

A Section 338(h)(10) election under Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10) allows a parent corporation to treat the acquisition of a subsidiary's stock as a deemed asset purchase for federal income tax purposes while maintaining the legal structure as a stock purchase.

Key Requirements for Section 338(h)(10) Election:

1. Stock Purchase Structure
The acquisition must be structured as a qualified stock purchase, meaning the purchasing corporation must acquire at least 80% of the subsidiary's stock within a 12-month period.

2. Joint Election Requirement  
Both the selling consolidated group (or selling affiliate) and the purchasing corporation must jointly file the Section 338(h)(10) election.

3. Filing Deadline
The election must be filed by the 15th day of the 9th month beginning after the month in which the acquisition date occurs.

4. Tax Consequences
- The selling group recognizes gain or loss as if the subsidiary sold its assets
- The purchasing corporation receives a stepped-up basis in the subsidiary's assets
- The subsidiary is deemed to have purchased its assets at fair market value

Section 338(g) vs 338(h)(10) Election Comparison

Section 338(g) elections result in double taxation, while Section 338(h)(10) elections avoid this issue when the target is a member of a consolidated group.

Revenue Ruling 2001-46 provides guidance on the application of Section 338(h)(10) elections in the context of mergers and acquisitions.

Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 provides detailed rules for making and implementing the election.
